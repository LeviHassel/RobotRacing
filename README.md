# Robot Racing

## Overview
This contains two projects designed in my Embedded Systems class. Each project involves a different build of an Arduino-based robot deisgned for a certain purpose. Line Tracer (Project 1) involves the robot being able to follow a black line on a white surface and Escape Artist (Project 2) tasks the robot with driving head-on towards an opponent in a course with only two exits, while following a line, swerving off course to dodge them and returning to the line to escape before the opponent.

## Requirements
This code is not going to be very useful unless you have an Arduino-based robot built exactly the way mine was. However, it works great when all you do is look at it. With a correctly built robot, all you need to do is download the Arduino IDE, connect the Arduino Uno to your PC using the USB plug and compile/run the code.
